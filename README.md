AlgonquinBook
=============

BB10 uses webworks, bbui.js cards, invocation, camera, calendar json and sqlite and map
This is a project done for the BB10 course at Algonquin College.
There is a bug on screen 1 as the title for each grid item tries to add itself twice so the title gets truncated.
Good examples for using javascript objects (cards).
For some reason the screen title gets wiped out after navigating to the maps section.
